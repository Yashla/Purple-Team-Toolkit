packages I needed to install:

Scan_ip.py: --- this has to be ran as root fs 
pip install scapy 



what i have done so far :
change of plan
allow for WRI on the windows devices 
allow ssh on the linux devices
allows for ssh on the macs

might us anisble instead of ssh.

andriod ??
iphones ??

when running these scripts to get the information about them i might need to store all the information into a text file
and format the text file in a way that can be passed to the api and qeurry straight away 


finding different types of devices:

windows : from port WRI open port  winrm = 5985 for http and 5986 for https
linux : ssh port 
Mac os : _raop._tcp.local. mdns
finding all printers ??


need to write as functions for the website. main




errors i have faced :
if log in fails program crashes 
making sure everyone has the correct logins 
running scans faster, like parralel execution.


i need to think of me storing all the script information into seperate database table called device_info 

device info will include 
OS verison 
open and closed ports 
all the applications that are installed AND running on each devices.(and somehow getting there versions number to then check if the software can be exploited.)
up time
network interfaces and info 
storage space 

maybe 2 types of scans so normal and one in detail.

checking if there any new devices on the network using ping or arp ???

i need to check that the ssh details actually correct


scanning 
    getting information to see if there a vulnerbility 

api request 
    getting data doing an api request to see if anything pops up any CVE will need a well known vulnerbaile iso for each os windows linux and mac.

storing it back in a speical database 
    report it back to the user 
        tell them what to do and how to do it.


getting the current os version 
    then comparing it to the latest version 
        finding all the CVE in the CVE from the difference so latest - current OS 
            and then becuase your os is older it has all the threats of these CVE all becuase your not upto date with the secuirty updates




WINDOWS 
Vendor = Microsoft (constant)
Product = two parts (windows_10_21h2) 

windows_xx = Write-Output ("Windows_" + (Get-ItemProperty 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion').CurrentMajorVersionNumber)

feature update version name = (Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion").DisplayVersion

both combined = Write-Output ("Windows_" + (Get-ItemProperty 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion').CurrentMajorVersionNumber + "_" + (Get-ItemProperty 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion').DisplayVersion)

Version = Write-Output ((Get-WmiObject Win32_OperatingSystem).Version + "." + (Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion").UBR)

Ubuntu (linux)

Vendor = canonical
Product = if grep -q '^NAME="Ubuntu"' /etc/os-release; then
  echo "ubuntu_linux"
fi

Version = cat /etc/os-release | grep '^VERSION_ID='


Mac
Vendor = apple
Product = sw_vers | awk '/ProductName/{print $2}'
Version = sw_vers | awk '/ProductVersion/{print $2}'
