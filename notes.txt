packages I needed to install:

Scan_ip.py: --- this has to be ran as root fs 
pip install scapy 



what i have done so far :
change of plan
allow for WRI on the windows devices 
allow ssh on the linux devices
allows for ssh on the macs

might us anisble instead of ssh.

andriod ??
iphones ??

when running these scripts to get the information about them i might need to store all the information into a text file
and format the text file in a way that can be passed to the api and qeurry straight away 


finding different types of devices:

windows : from port WRI open port  winrm = 5985 for http and 5986 for https
linux : ssh port 
Mac os : _raop._tcp.local. mdns


need to write as functions for the website. main
